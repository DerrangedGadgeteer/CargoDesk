# Disaster Cleanup
Based on our collective experience cleaning up after hurricane Chantrel caused massive flooding in our area, this is a kit to equip one volunteer with PPE and basic, universal supplies so they can simply show up to a relief event.  This Kit fits easily in its 5 gallon bucket for storage and transport.
## Checklist

- Qty:2 pair Shoe Covers
- Qty:4 N95 Dust Masks/Qty:1 P100 Respirator
- LED Headlamp w/ spare batteries
- Qty:8 pair Nitrile Gloves
- pair Cut-resistant Gloves
- Face Shield/Safety Glasses
- Wet Wipes
- Mini First Aid Kit/Band-aids & Tape
- Contractor Trash Bags
- Roll of Paper Towels
- Roll of Duck Tape

## Explaination
The supplies selected for inclusion in this kit were ones that were used by pretty much everyone participating in the "muck & gut" of locations flooded during Chantrel.
- Buckets were not heavily used, however, there was a definite need for somewhere to keep supplies and volunteer's personal belongings clean and dry when no clean and dry places were available.
- Some Volunteers elected to throw out the clothes they wore to the event, on account of how dirty they had become.  Not so for volunteers who chose to wear coveralls.  The choice between inexpensive painter's coveralls, and a full-body Tyvek Suit is down to the environment.  Many volunteers didn't wear available suits due to extreme heat and humiditiy.  No one, suited or not, suffered physical effects due to getting flood muck splashed on their skin or clothes.  Recommendation: Lightweight painters coveralls, unless there is a specific, unique hazard that requires the full coverage of a Tyvek Suit.
- Shoe Covers were universally appreciated, but wore out quickly during the Muck & Gut.  Two pairs minimum per volunteer.
- N95 dust masks are the minimum recommended respriatory protection for this kind of work. However, there were some problems that led to them being frequently discarded.
    1. Masks were uncomfortable, and in the heat and humidity caused volunteer's glasses and safety glasses to fog up.
    2. Elastic bands frequently snapped off of the masks.  Almost half of all volunteers experienced this failure, and two had it happen more than once.
    3. Some volunteers found the mask's filtration inadequate, still struggling with the smells and particulates in the air despite wearing the mask.
       For this reason, recommendation is a supply of 4 N95 masks per kit, or as an alternative, a p100 half-face respirator.  This is a subject which requires further investigation, as multiple volunteers reported physical effects from breathing in the flooded environments.
 - Headlamps were absolutely critical.  No location being cleaned up post-flood had power.  Some volunteers brought battery powered lights, but those were of limited use, needing to be moved and repositioned constantly.  Every Volunteer should be supplied with a headlamp, and spare batteries.  Rechargeable Headlamps are another possibility, but rechargeables don't suit themselves to being kept in a prepackaged kit like this.
 - Nitrile Gloves were universally used and appreciated.  Frequently worn alone, or underneath cut-resistant gloves.  They wore out, tore, or got too full of sweat very frequently.  Spares are a must, 8 pair.
 - Cut-Resistant Gloves were used by most volunteers.  Common Garden Gloves worked for most things, as did industrial cut-resistant gloves.  Rubber-dipped fabric gloves were the most appropriate, balancing protection with dexterity.  They quickly became soiled however, and required nitrile under-gloves and/or replacement.  1 pair minimum, spares recommended.
 - Face Shields were preferred by volunteers over safety goggles and safety glasses.  Face Shields provide better coverage, Better visibilty, less tendency to fog up.  However, they made it difficult to wear a headlamp.  Safety Goggles were brought by at least 2 volunteers, and immediately discarded due to comfort and fogging issues.  Simple saftey glasses were more widely used, but still experienced fogging problems.  Due to these problems, some volunteers chose to forego eye protection entirely.
 - Wet Wipes were necessary, because only one relief location happened to have a running-water hand washing station.  That accomodation shouldn't be relied upon.  Also, since wet wipes don't store well once they've been opened, it's recommended that if a package of wipes are opened, that package should be replaced within the next week.
 - Small cuts and scrapes were the most common injuries during the cleanouts, and the floodwater environment threatens a higher rate of infection.  Cuts, even small ones need to be cleaned and dressed quickly when working in this kind of environment.  Combining the wet wipes with either a "Mini First-Aid Kit" or a package of Band-aids, tape, and triple antibiotic should prevent any major complications, even in such unsanitary conditions.
 - Trash bags were readily available, most volunteer organizers and teams already had plenty.  However, making sure each volunteer has several heavy-duty bags is prudent in case there is not larger-scale planning and organizing at the aid site.
 - Paper Towels were indespensible.  Whether drying or cleaning things, wiping sweat, use as a hankercheif, etc.  Every roll of paper towels got at least partially used, and every volunteer had need of it at one point or another.
 - Duck Tape was needed for taping up boxes, taping up trash bags, and covering up cut/puncture hazards.
